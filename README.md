# React-Draggable

This is a fork from the original [React Draggable](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-draggable) with a single difference: it has not prevent default in the touchstart for mobile devices. Instead it gives you the opportunite to make the "preventDefault" on touch capture, in case you want.

It was just a personal need of a project I [@azabraao](https://github.com/azabraao) was working on. In case it helps you too, I will be very happy :)

For docs and everything else, please, [refer to the original source](https://github.com/react-grid-layout/react-draggable).
